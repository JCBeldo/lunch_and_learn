## Lunch and Learn
Lunch and Learn is backend application built with Ruby on Rails. It is a student project from Turing's Backend Module 3 program.
It is an API based application that allows users to search for recipes based on an searched country. From there they can learn more about the country by watching YouTube videos or finding books about said country. Users will be able to add favorites to their personal list of recipe faves. 
This app follows RESTful API conventions.

### Learning Goals
The learning goals of this project were to 
- expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
- expose an API that requires an authentication token
- implement basic authentication
- expose an API for CRUD functionality
- determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
- test both API consumption and exposure
- make use of at least one mocking tool (VCR)
